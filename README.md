# Setting up a virtual environment - venv
#### Use
This is used to create an environment where only the python libraries that are needed for this project are installed.  It is an alternative to installing libraries globally and helps to ensure that the proper version is installed based on what is listed in the requirements.txt file for the project that is being worked on.  Python3 comes with venv included 

#### Assumptions
Commands used is for Mac.  Python 3.7.1 or higher is installed
